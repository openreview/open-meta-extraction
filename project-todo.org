** List project plan for current task


** Next Actions



** Tasks
- [ ] Delete /tmp files created by chrome
- [ ] Reap dead chrome instances
- [ ] Fix documentation (some sidebar links don't work)
- [ ] Bug: when fetch service finishes, it loops around and causes key error on save note
- [ ] system crashes when openreview rest api fails (e.g., during server restarts)
- [ ] Add cli switch to save artifacts after spidering/extraction (for use when writing new rules)

- better parameterization of mocktimestamps on testing
** Ideas
- [TaskScheduler] allow multiple extraction workers when responseUrl is known and hosts can be spread out over time


** Error when running fetch service off the edge of the cliff

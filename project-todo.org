** List project plan for current task


** Next Actions

- [ ] Bug: note iterator continually serves final paper
- [ ] Reprocessing logic
- [ ] Use Grobid to get abstracts from PDF when not available in html

- [-] <Monitor> Add more stats to monitor
  - [X] Num pdf w/o abstract (done)
  - [ ] Progress for extraction/re-processing
  - [ ] monitor disk usage


** Tasks
- [ ] Bug: corpus artifacts are not always cleaned up (only on extraction success)
- [ ] Feature: Send notify message when there are critical errors, or on certain events
- [ ] Improvement: Reap dead chrome instances, cleanup /tmp files
- [ ] Bug: when fetch service finishes, it loops around and causes key error on save note
- [ ] Feature: Add cli switch to save artifacts after spidering/extraction (for use when writing new rules)
- [ ] Feature: Save full abs/pdflink in shadow
- [ ] regularize status update send times
- [ ] Improvement: make notification happen at particular clock times, rather than every X hours
- [ ] Ability to re-process entire corpus from beginning to fill in gaps
- [ ] Create Q/A system for checking abstracts
- [ ] Scheduled db backup

** Ideas
- [ ] [TaskScheduler] multi task spidering/extraction (not doing for now, doesn't seem worthwhile)
- Error incorrectly logged when rewriting URLs (e.g., doi.org/arxiv..)
   error [ExtractionService] [] Fetch chain head !== specified request URL

** Done
- [X] Fix documentation (some sidebar links don't work)

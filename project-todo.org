** List project plan for current task


** Next Actions

  - [X] HttpServer
  - [ ] BrowserPool
  - [ ] Fetch
  - [X] Monitor
  - [ ] Mongo
- [ ] Save full abs/pdflink in shadow
- [ ] Add more stats to monitor (total found, %done)


** Tasks
- [ ] Send notify message when there are critical errors, or on certain events
- [ ] Reap dead chrome instances, cleanup /tmp files
- [ ] Fix documentation (some sidebar links don't work)
- [ ] Bug: when fetch service finishes, it loops around and causes key error on save note
- [ ] Add cli switch to save artifacts after spidering/extraction (for use when writing new rules)
- [ ] [TaskScheduler] allow multiple extraction workers when responseUrl is known and hosts can be spread out over time
** Ideas

- better parameterization of mocktimestamps on testing
- Notifications when system is generating errors

** Complete

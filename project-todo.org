    - error [ExtractionService] [] Fetch chain head !== specified request URL
  - [ ] response/responseHost might be combined
  - [ ] eliminate workflow status
  - [ ] factor out rate limiting logic
  - [ ] factor out limit # to process logic (asyncIter.zipWithIndex)

  - [ ] factor out pauseBeforeExit logic (for PM2 restarts)
  - [ ] [build system] compare tsup/tsc vs rush build/watch speeds


** Error
There is an as-yet unfixed error which stops with the following message
    83|RunExtractionService  | Error:
    83|RunExtractionService  |       null
    83|RunExtractionService  |
    83|RunExtractionService  |           Error was: CastError: Cast to Number failed for value "NaN" (type number) at path "httpStatus"
    83|RunExtractionService  |

It seemed to be coming from these URLs, but I cannot reproduce it.
